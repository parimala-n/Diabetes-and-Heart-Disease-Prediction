# Diabetes-and-Heart-Disease-Prediction
## Installations:
The project has been done in the jupyter enviroment with python 3.6. All the package requires are mentioned in requirement.txt

## Motivatoin:
To perform analysis on two different disease dataset to predict the chances of having a particular diseases by using different machine learning algorithm and also to check that which particular algorithm performs the best on the given dataset.
This project uses KNN, SVM, Logistic Regression and decision tree to predict the output on the given dataset.
The dataset has been taken from https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets.php for both diabetes and heart disesase.

## Summary
I found that SVM outperforms the remaining 3 algorithm as it gives an accuracy of 89% on diabetic data set and 80% on heart disease dataset.
